    	<p class="lead">Exercises to help explain how Data Modeling works!</p>

        <h3 id="exercise1">Modeling Places</h3>
        <p>In this exercise, you'll model two places for storage in a reviews website like Yelp, Google Local, or Foursquare.</p>
        <p>We're not terribly worried about format for this. <strong>PAIR UP</strong> and don't worry about getting JSON exactly right - the important part is "name" : "value".
        If you get stuck trying to read something you wrote, here's a <a href="http://json.parser.online.fr/">JSON Parser</a> that will organize things for you.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>First, create a new file - call it places.json</li>
            <li>Start with an array with two or more objects - <code>[{}, {}, {}]</code></li>
            <li>We're going to model places from this list, or choose your own favorite places!
                <ul>
                    <li>http://www.yelp.com/biz/dartealing-lounge-san-francisco</li>
                    <li>http://www.yelp.com/biz/peets-coffee-and-tea-san-francisco-4</li>
                    <li>http://www.yelp.com/biz/acme-bread-company-san-francisco-2</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Ask yourself these questions:
                <ul>
                    <li>What properties do each of these places have? An address? A name?</li>
                    <li>How are they different?</li>
                    <li>What makes them different <em>in the same way?</em> (like type: grocery store, or pub, or coffee shop)</li>
                    <li>What information is useful, vs not useful? (phone numbers are useful, but number of bricks isn't. Unless you are building a national brick database.)</li>
                    <li>What is someone looking for when they look up information about this thing? What am <em>I</em> looking for?</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Try to store some information unique to each place - maybe a section from a menu at a food place, or credentials for the dentist. Models don't always have to be the same, but they do need a "baseline" of similarity.</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
        <h3 id="exercise2">Modeling Movies!</h3>
        <p>Making movies takes lots of relationships - Actors, Producers, Studios - we don't want to duplicate data, so let's form some relationships!</p>

        <ul>
            <li>First, create a new file - call it movies.json</li>
            <li>Start with three arrays with four or more objects - 
                <pre>
Movies = [{}, {}, {}, {}]
Actors = [{}, {}, {}, {}]
Studios = [{}, {}, {}, {}]
                </pre>
            </li>
            <li>We're going to model four different movies!
                <ul>
                    <li>Les Misérables - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1707386/</li>
                    <li>The Soloist - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0821642/</li>
                    <li>Sherlock Holmes - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0988045/</li>
                    <li>Rise of the Guardians - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1446192/</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>These share actors, so we're going to assign an ID to each actor, studio, and movie.</li>
            <li>In each movie there are lots of actors - list only the top-billed actors for simplicity's sake. Create an array to hold just the IDs of the actors.</li>
            <li>Reference the ID of the actor you want to name by looking in your list of actors, and using the ID field.</li>
            <li>Do the same for the studios- reference them by ID (but you don't have to use an array)</li>
            <li>Try to simplify the studios - don't distinguish between Universal Studios and Universal Studios France. We're not IMDB :)</li>
        </ul>
