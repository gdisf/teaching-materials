# Object-Oriented JavaScript

In this workshop, you'll learn the principles of Object-Oriented programming and how you can apply those principles in JavaScript to architect your code better. Understanding that will help your code as it gets larger, and is a crucial skill for using JS in a large codebase, like at a company.

The workshop will be a mix of lectures and hands-on exercises in pairs. It will be taught by {{ teacher_name }}, {{ teacher_description }}.

This is a great follow-up workshop for those who attended our Intro to JavaScript workshop.

## Topics covered

Object instances, properties, methods
Using .prototype for OO in JS
