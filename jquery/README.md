# Intro to jQuery

Slides and materials are hosted [here](http://teaching-materials.org/jquery).

## Course description

In this evening workshop, we will introduce jQuery, the most popular JavaScript library for making webpages interactive. The workshop will be a mix of lectured and hands-on exercises in pairs. This is the perfect follow-up workshop for those who have attended our "JS & the Web" workshop.

### Prerequisites:

Attendees should be comfortable with HTML/CSS fundamentals (HTML tags and attributes, CSS selectors) and JavaScript fundamentals (syntax, data structures, conditionals, loops). Attendees should also have learned the DOM API (access and modication methods). That means that you either attended our HTML 101 workshop, JS 101 workshop, and JS 200 workshop, or that you learned those concepts online. 

You can review them online at a few places:
* HTML/CSS: [Khan Academy's HTML/CSS course](https://khanacademy.org/html-css), [Codecademy's HTML/CSS course](https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web), [GDI SF HTML/CSS slides](http://teaching-materials.org/htmlcss-1day)
* JS: [Codecademy's JS course](https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript), [Khan Academy's Intro to JS course](https://khanacademy.org/programming),  [GDI SF JS slides](http://teaching-materials.org/javascript)
* DOM API: [Khan Academy's "Making Webpages Interactive" course](https://khanacademy.org/html-css-js)


### Tech requirements:

* Your laptop (Mac, PC, or Linux are all okay). 
* A modern web browser - either Chrome or Firefox. 
* A text editor. We recommend Sublime Text 2 (free; available for both Mac and PC) or Notepad++ (PC).
