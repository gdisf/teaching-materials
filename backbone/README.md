# Intro to Backbone

Slides and materials are hosted [here](http://teaching-materials.org/backbone).

## Course description

In this workshop, you'll learn all about Backbone.js, a popular front-end javascript library for creating dynamic, interactive web interfaces. 

The workshop will be a mix of lectures and hands-on exercises in pairs. This workshop is highly recommended for anyone attending our frontend workshop series and is a perfect follow-up for our JS MVC workshop.
