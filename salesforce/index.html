					This is the plan for the day. The bulk of the time is you building a sample app. For this hands on project, you will be signing up for a Trailhead account and getting your very own, free, Developer Edition login for Salesforce. We’ll walk through that when we get to the first step of the project.

					As [GDI leader] said, you’re going to build a simple app today and the bulk of the time is hands on. The project has 6 steps, covering 6 key areas of app development in Salesforce and in any platform. I will introduce the concept for each step, demo the tools, and then you’ll get hands on in Salesforce’s online training platform, Trailhead.

					 	Now we want to know a little about you. <br>
				 		[This takes some time, depending on class size, but it worth it because them people get to know each other a little and get more comfortable. Students connecting with each other is just as important as learning the material. Pick your favorite icebreaker: favorite breakfast food, favorite candy, favorite Girl Scout Cookie, favorite ice cream, would you rather be invisible or be able to fly, do you prefer Star Wars or Star Trek or neither, favorite mobile app?] <br>
				 		[Note: In one class we made a Spotify playlist out of everyone’s favorite music and played it during the hands on time. The students enjoyed that and we all heard some new music.]

	 					We have wondering volunteers from the local Salesforce Women in Technology user group. Salesforce has many user groups, some are focused on developers, some on end users and admins, and the WIT groups are focused on women supporting each other’s success. We have WIT groups in 30 cities around the world. I’d like to give the volunteers a minute to introduce themselves and give a little background as to how they got into Salesforce and what their current role is. And I highly encourage everyone to ask tons of questions and get to know them during the day. One of the biggest strengths of the Salesforce platform is the strength of the community.<br>
	 					[have TAs intro themselves, including their role and how they first got into Salesforce – keep it short, 1 min each]

					Which run on the Salesforce platform, along with 100s of partner apps, and countless customer-built custom apps ...<br>
					Built and implemented by our community members, which we call Trailblazers because they are the ones leading their companies to success.<br>

				<h3>What Will We Build?</h3>
				<h4>Business Requirements</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Your battle station was destroyed. You need to build another.</li>
					<li>As the construction project manager, your primary goals are to:
						<ul>
							<li>manage the construction of the Battle Station</li>
							<li>live longer than your predecessor</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>You decide to manage your project with Salesforce. This way everyone on your team can collaborate, be successful, and stay alive.</li>
				</ul>
				<img src="images/battle-station-logo.png" alt="Battle Station App Logo" class="noborder">
				<aside class="notes">
					We’re going to use the Salesforce platform to build a simple, employee-facing project management app.<br><br>
					Why does the business need this app? Before you build any app for your business, you should gather the business requirements. We’ve done that for you.<br><br>
					It looks like this app is important because your life depends on it. As you’ll see in the opening paragraphs in the Build a Battle Station App Trailhead Project, the first Battle Station project didn’t go that well…<br><br>
					So we’re going to build this app using the Salesforce Platform.<br><br>
					Project Management is one type of app you can build with the Salesforce Platform – You can add new apps to track anything you want – like volunteers for a non-profit org, or job positions and applicants for recruiting, or employee performance goals, or dogs in shelters. [poll the TAs for other types of apps they’ve built]

				<h3>Why No Code?</h3>
				<h4>Metadata!</h4>
				<img src="images/metadata.png" alt="Metadata screenshot" class="noborder fullwidth">
				<aside class="notes">
					Today you will build a complete, working enterprise application accessible through a browser or mobile device. Yup, you will! This class will walk you through how to build each part of this application: first the data model, which will generate a default user interface, then configuring the user interface, then adding business logic and analytics. And finally, viewing your app on a mobile device.<br><br>
					How is it possible to build this all without code? Because the Salesforce Platform runs with a layer of Metadata that defines the shape and behavior of the applications. Metadata is data that describes other data. On the Salesforce Platform, most of what you build is done with metadata, where you describe what you want via point & click and the system creates the database, pages, logic, and reports for you.

				<aside class="notes">
					Let’s take a look at what you’ll have at the end of class…<br>
					[Take a minute to demo the completed app. People want to see where they are going. <br>
					Demo steps:<br>
					open a Battlestation record, show the details & related lists (supplies & resources), and point out the custom fields for each. <br>
					show the dashboards - this is how all of this data will be viewed by your chief executive <br>
					show it on the mobile simulator (using the Salesforce1 Chrome extension) - all of the metadata that controls the browser app is also controlling the mobile app]
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Demo: Setup</h3>
				<img src="images/setup-home.png" alt="Setup screenshot" class="noborder fullwidth">
				<aside class="notes">
					We will create all of this metadata in Setup. We do not need to download any software to develop this app – all the tools we need are in the cloud.<br>
					Let’s look around Setup a little before we start building.<br>
					[Demo setup. Explain the user view vs the developer view in the browser app.<br>
					Include Quick Find in Setup. Step 1 has them searching for Object Manager in Quick Find.<br>
					Open the Battle Station object - explain that every app tracks SOMETHING and the app they are building tracks Battle Station projects, so they will be creating the shell of that object in Step 1, and then adding fields to it in Step 2]<br><br>
					Setup is where you can control the internet!

				<h3>Salesforce Terminology</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>App</strong>: collection of tabs</li>
					<li><strong>Tab</strong>: how users navigates to data (aka records)</li>
					<li><strong>Records</strong>: anything you can make a list of (e.g., battle stations)</li>
					<li><strong>Object</strong>: a place to store records + metadata</li>
				</ul>
				<aside class="notes">
					Here are some terms you will hear a lot when building with Salesforce. In this first Step, you created the scaffolding for a new app by just providing a few details, then the platform will generate the metadata you need to get started, including an app, a tab, and an object that will store your records.<br><br>
					Remember metadata…? [pop quiz! “What is metadata?” A: data that describes other data]
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>The <strong>Battle Station Construction</strong> App</h3>
				<p>We need to define more metadata for our app.</p>
				<img src="images/metadata-data-model.png" alt="Data Models" class="noborder fullwidth">
				<aside class="notes">
					Metadata is data that describes other data. <br>
					We’ve created some metadata: the object definition for Battle Stations and the tab definition for that object and the app definition that included the tab (and by association, the object).<br><br>

					What we’ll do in the next 5 steps:<br>
					Create the data storage for the app by adding more fields to the Battle Station object and adding 2 more objects.<br>
					Modify the user interface for the app for both the browser and the Salesforce1 Mobile view.<br>
					Implement business logic using formulas, validation rules and a process builder.<br>
					Build reports and dashboards to track the status of supplies and analyze how well the company manages resources.<br>
					Customize the mobile interface to make it more efficient for your battle station users.

				<h3>A Database is Like a Spreadsheet</h3>
				<img src="images/spreadsheet-1.png" alt="Spreadsheet screenshot 1" class="noborder" style="position:relative; left:-25%;">

				<aside class="notes">
					Who is familiar with Excel? When you create an excel spreadsheet to track information, you are doing a form of data modeling – you decide what each column is named, based on the pieces of data you need to track, like the Date of an Event or a person’s Name. Each row of data is about a specific event or person or whatever you are tracking. You may also create multiple “sheets” to logically separate the things you are tracking.<br><br>

					For our Battle Station Construction app, we need to track the items related to our projects. You’ve already created the Battle Station object, but you need to track more information about each station. In a spreadsheet you would track that by adding columns for Project Status and Weapons Status.<br><br>

					We also need to track the Resources (people) and Supplies for each battle station. In a spreadsheet that could be captured in 2 new sheets. <br><br>
					The Resources sheet would include columns for the Resource Name, Quantity and Utilization. It would also include a column for the Battle Station Name so that you know which station these resources belong to. <br><br>
					The Supplies sheet would include columns for the Supply Name, Quantity, Unit Cost, and Total Cost. Again, you would need to include a column for the Battle Station Name so that you know which station these supplies belong to<br><br>

					Who is familiar with relational databases? In a relational database, data is stored in tables. Each table comprises a number of columns of a particular data type, such as text, number, or date. Information is stored in rows of the table. Tables can be related to other tables, using primary and foreign keys. Apps manage information by creating, reading, updating, and deleting rows in a table.<br><br>

					In Salesforce, the database terminology is a little different.

				<h3>Relational Databases have Relationships</h3>

				<aside class="notes">
					Who is familiar with relational databases? Each relational database table comprises a number of columns of a particular data type, such as text, number, or date. Information is stored in rows of the table. Again, it’s helpful to visualize these tables as spreadsheets.<br><br>

					In a relational database, data is stored in tables and is linked to other data based on defined relationships. That’s what was missing in the spreadsheet - we had to keep repeating the Battle Station Name but the relationship between the Battle Station sheet and the other 2 sheets is not defined. Tables can be related to other tables, using primary and foreign keys. [click] For example, tweets and followers are related to users. <br><br>

					Apps manage information by creating, reading, updating, and deleting rows in a table. This is called CRUD. In Salesforce, your data is stored based on your Object metadata and you can relate Objects to each other via multiple types of Relationships. You users will be creating, reading, updating, and deleting records in the objects you create.<br><br>

					The Salesforce database terminology is a little different, so let’s cover that...<br><br>

				<h3>Data Modeling Terminology</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Standard Objects</strong>: objects included with Salesforce to store data (records) about things like Accounts, Contacts, Opportunities</li>
					<li><strong>Custom Objects</strong>: new objects you create to store data (records) – custom objects are unique to your company</li>
					<li><strong>Fields</strong>: place to store an individual piece of data for a record – similar to a column in Excel or in a relational database</li>
					<li><strong>Relationships</strong>: special type of field that connects objects</li>
				</ul>

				<aside class="notes">
					Salesforce provides a powerful database, with many features that make it faster and easier to create applications. <br><br>

					Salesforce uses objects to store data. Objects contain all the functionality you expect in a table, with additional metadata for user interface and business logic that make them more powerful and versatile. Each object comprises a number of fields, which correspond to columns in a database. Data is stored in records of the object, which correspond to rows in a database.<br><br>

					Some terms you’ll be hearing a lot:<br>
					There are two types of objects.<br>
					Standard Objects—These are objects included with Salesforce, by default, for example the objects used to store data in standard tabs such as accounts, contacts, or opportunities.<br>
					Custom Objects—These are new objects you create to store information unique to your organization. <br>
					Fields are where the data is stored in your objects.<br>
					Relationships connect the objects. This is important for how your users navigate in the user interface and also for how you access data for reports.

					Here is a sneak peek at the data model for the Battle Station Construction app. You will build three custom objects and define two relationships. <br><br>

					Battle Station - This will be our main object that tracks each battle station project. You created this object in Step 1, but you need to add some fields to track the project and weapons status of each battle station.<br>
					Resource - Projects are about doing "stuff" and you need resources (i.e., people) to do "stuff". You’ll create a resources custom object to track the number of people working on the construction project and how much time they are committed to it. Examples of people you might need: Dark Lord, Welder, Exhaust Port Inspector.<br>
					Supply - You also need supplies and equipment to build a Battle Station. We'll use this object to track our supplies and their costs. Examples of supplies you might need: Hammers, Nails, Light Bulbs.

				<img src="images/metadata-ui.png" alt="Metadata User Interface" class="noborder fullwidth">

				<aside class="notes">
					Metadata! In this step, you’ll modify the user interface for the app to make it more intuitive.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>UI & UX</h3>

				<ul>
					<li>A <strong>user interface</strong> (UI) is how people interact with the apps you create.</li>
					<li><strong>User Experience</strong> (UX) is how a person feels about your product</li>
				</ul>

				<aside class="notes">
					The more intuitive you make your user interface, the more your users will enjoy and use your app.<br><br>

					[audience interaction time!]<br>
					What’s your favorite app? Why? How do you interact with it? What feels intuitive?<br><br>

					User Experience is especially important for mobile apps, because if you are trying to move a set of employees from a desktop app to a mobile app, they need to LOVE that mobile app, or they won’t use it. In this step we’ll improve the user interface for the desktop version, and in the final step, we’ll see that those same fields are in the mobile version, but that there are additional things we can do to make the mobile experience even better.<br><br>

					In this step we’ll use Page Layouts and Rollup Summary fields.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Page Layout Editor</h3>

				<img src="images/page-layout-editor.png" alt="Page Layout Editor screenshot" class="noborder">

				<aside class="notes">
					Page layouts allow you to customize the design and organization of detail and edit pages in Salesforce.<br>
					Control both the browser pages and the mobile pages<br>
					Control which fields, related lists, buttons, links users see.<br>
					Determine whether fields are visible, read only, or required on detail and edit pages.<br><br>

					The Page Layout Editor is what’s called a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editor. You can drag & drop all of the elements that are on the page where you users will view the data in a record. <br>

					DEMO: [show how there are different categories in the “palette” and how to drag & drop things. Show how to create a new section. Show how to change the fields shown in a related list.]

				<h2>Step 4: Business Logic</h2>
				<aside class="notes">
					Now you can get data in and out of your database, but let’s make our app do more.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>The Battle Station App</h3>

				<img src="images/metadata-business-logic.png" alt="Metadata Business Logic" class="noborder fullwidth">

				<aside class="notes">
					In this step you’ll implement business logic by creating metadata to enforce the rules for your company.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>What is Business Logic?</h3>

				<ul>
					<li>All organizations have processes. Some are well documented. Others, not. Business logic in your app is a way to <strong>enforce</strong> and <strong>automate</strong> those processes.</li>
					<li><strong>Validation Rules</strong>: Enforcing business processes improves data quality. If it’s not valid to have an invoice without a dollar amount, then don’t let people save one.</li>
					<li><strong>Process Builder</strong>: Automating business processes increases productivity in your organization. If the next step is always to send the customer an email, then let the system do that.</li>
				</ul>

				<aside class="notes">
					We’re going to add business logic to our app with two different tools: Validation Rules and Process Builder.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>What is Business Logic?</h3>

				<ul>
					<li>Enforce data quality</li>
					<li>Are associated with an object</li>
					<li>Are run when a record for that object is created or updated</li>
					<li>Use formulas to express when data is <em>invalid</em></li>
				</ul>

				<aside class="notes">
					Validation rules verify that data entered by users in records meet the standards you specify before they can save it. <br>

					Using validation rules effectively contributes to quality data. For example, you can ensure that all Order Numbers or Social Security Numbers are the right format.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Formulas</h3>

				<ul>
					<li>A <strong>formula</strong> is an algorithm, similar to a macro in a typical spreadsheet program, that derives a value from other fields, expressions, or values. </li>
					<li>You can use formulas in many contexts in Salesforce, including <strong>Validation Rules</strong> and <strong>Process Builder processes</strong>.</li>
				</ul>

				<aside class="notes">
					You created a formula field in step 2<br>
					A formula is an algorithm, similar to a macro in a typical spreadsheet program, that derives a value from other fields, expressions, or values. Formulas have many uses — for example, for an object, use can create a custom formula field that automatically calculates the value of the field based the value in other fields of the same record. But that's just a simple example — you can use formulas in many contexts, including:<br>
					custom fields<br>
					default field values<br>
					data validations<br>
					reports<br>
					workflow field updates<br>
					workflow rules<br>
					approval processes<br>
					approval steps<br>
					escalation rules<br>
					assignment rules<br>
					custom buttons and links<br>
					Visualforce pages

				<h3>Demo: Validation Rules</h3>

				<img src="images/validation-rules.png" alt="Validation rules flow" class="noborder fullwidth">

				<aside class="notes">
					This is how the system sees the flow of a validation rule.  Note that we are going to define a statement which if TRUE means the data Is bad.<br>

					Demo in Setup<br>
					[Have this “don’t add supplies to a complete project” rule (details in the slide) already set up. Show it in the Validation Rule formula editor. Show entering bad data and getting the error message. Show entering good data successfully.]
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Process Builder</h3>

				<ul>
					<li><strong>Process Builder</strong> allows you to automate business processes using a graphical representation of your process. </li>
					<li>Processes are associated with an <strong>object</strong>. Processes are run <strong>when a record is created or updated</strong> for that object. </li>
					<li>Processes consist of <strong>criteria</strong> that determine whether or not to execute <strong>actions</strong>.</li>
				</ul>

				<aside class="notes">
					The other tool we’ll use is Process Builder.  Process Builder is a workflow tool that helps you easily automate your business processes by providing a powerful and user-friendly graphical representation of your process as you build it. You simply point-and-click to build your processes which run "behind the scenes" in response to actions.
				</aside>

					[Goal is to orient students to how to use the tool. Select an existing process (e.g., the Fully Operational Battle Station process from the project . Click slowly through each block in the diagram, showing how the values are defined.<br>
					Also show them how to TEST their process. In the project, the instructions say “Simply edit a Battle Station record” (full text below) which is confusing to first-timers. Demoing this and explaining that they will be building in Setup and then switching back to the end user view to the Battle Stations tab and selecting a record (what’s a record???) to edit, make the change to the Weapons Status field and Save and they should see the process actions in action.]<br>
