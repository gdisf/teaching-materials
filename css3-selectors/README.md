# Advanced CSS: CSS3 Selectors

In this workshop, you will learn modern CSS3 selectors that will let you write more powerful, specific CSS rules. You'll strengthen your CSS rule writing muscles, helping you be more comfortable in the <style> tag.

The workshop will be a mix of lectures and hands-on exercises in pairs. It will be taught by {{ teacher_name }}, {{ teacher_description }}.

This is a great follow-up workshop for those who attended our Intro to HTML & CSS workshop.
