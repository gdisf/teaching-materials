# CSS3 Selectors

In this workshop, you will gain a solid understanding of modern CSS3 selectors that will let you write more powerful, specific CSS rules. You'll strengthen your CSS rule writing muscles, helping you be more comfortable in the `<style>` tag.

The workshop will be a mix of lectures and hands-on exercises. It will be taught by `{{ teacher_name }}`, `{{ teacher_description }}`.

This is a great follow-up workshop for those who attended our Intro to HTML & CSS workshop.

**Topics covered**

- **Review of CSS relational selectors:** How to select and style elements of the page based on where they are in relation to other elements. You'll learn how to do this as specifically or generally as you want (all images, all images in lists, all images in a specific list).
- **CSS3 pseudo-class selectors** How to select and style elements based on information about their state (e.g. when you hover over an element or enter data into a form). 
- **CSS3 pseudo-element selectors** How to create and style new elements that you add with CSS. These elements do not initially appear in the HTML of a webpage.
