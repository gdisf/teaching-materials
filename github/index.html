            <p>A fork is just a copy of a repository, saved to GitHub.</p>

      <h3>Establishing a connection to an upstream repo </h3>
      <p>To sync your fork with the original repo, you need to add another remote named upstream</p>
        <pre style="width: 100%;"><code>
$ git remote -v
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/gdisf/tiny-repo.git
$ git fetch upstream
        </code></pre>
Downloads Git references not present in your local repository, but does not modify your files (think of it like getting a table of contents rather than the contents themselves)

        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Shared Repos</h3>
          <p>If team members are contributing to a single repo, each member of the team will want to make sure that she has everyone else's changes before pushing her own changes to the GitHub repo.</p>
          <div class="fragment">
        <h4 class="green">Always pull before you push!</h4>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section>
        <h3>Pulling</h3>
            Commit local changes first
            <pre><code class ="command-line">
$ git commit -m "My latest commit"
            </code></pre>
            Get changes that have been pushed to the remote repo
            <pre><code class ="command-line">
$ git pull origin master
            </code></pre>
            Git may prompt you to fix any conflicts, then commit
            <pre><code class ="command-line">
$ git commit -m "Fixing merging conflicts"
            </code></pre>
            Now you are ready to push local changes to GitHub
            <pre><code class ="command-line">
$ git push origin master

        <section>
          <h3>Starting a pull request</h3>
          <p>You need to do this on GitHub, not from the command line.</p>

        <section>
          <h3>Managing pull requests</h3>
            <p>If you are the owner of repo, you will review and decide whether to merge in the pull requests you receive.</p><br>

            <p>You can learn more from the <br><a href = "https://help.github.com/categories/collaborating/" target ="_blank" alt = "Links to information on GitHub about pull requests and collaboration">Github Collaborating Tutorials.</a> </p>

        <section>
          <h3>Editing pull requests</h3>
            <p>To make changes to an existing pull request, commit changes to the same branch, and push them to GitHub. They'll be added to the PR automatically.</p>
            <pre><code class ="command-line">
$ git pull origin my-pr-branch
$ git commit -m "Fix typos"
$ git push origin my-pr-branch
            </code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Making multiple pull requests</h3>
            <p>Because any new commits to a branch will be added to that branch's pull request, you need to make any new, unrelated changes to a <span class="green">new branch</span>.</p>
            <pre><code class ="command-line">
$ git checkout master
$ git checkout -b new-feature-branch
$ git commit -m "Add a fancy new feature"
$ git push origin new-feature-branch
            </code></pre>
            <p>Be sure the new branch is based off of the master branch, and not your other working branch.</p>
