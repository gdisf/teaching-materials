# Working with APIs in JS

Slides and materials are hosted [here](http://www.teaching-materials.org/).

## Course description

An API is a service that lets one website use data or functionality from another website, and most modern webpages rely on at least one API - like the Facebook API for social interaction, the Google Analytics API for tracking, or the DoubleClick API for ads. In this workshop, you'll learn how JavaScript-based APIs actually work behind the scenes, plus be introduced to a wealth of APIs to enhance your websites. 

The workshop will be a mix of lectures and hands-on exercises in pairs, and will be taught by [teacher X, tiny bio]. This workshop is highly recommended for anyone attending our frontend workshop series.
