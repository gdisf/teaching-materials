Thanks for attending the workshop, and thank you to our TAs [TODO: TA names] for being such great helpers. We’d love your feedback on the workshop in this survey. [TODO: Add link to survey]

The slides are available at:
http://teaching-materials.org/apis/
We will try to always keep them available at that URL.

If you try out the final exercise and have any questions on it, feel free to put the code up on github, jsbin, or jsfiddle, and email with questions. I encourage you to look around your blog, website, company’s site, etc, to find ways you can sprinkle APIs (and decide if it’s worth it, of course).

You can also do codelabs on Codecademy that use APIs - search for the ones on this page that list “JavaScript”:
https://www.codecademy.com/apis

For those of you asking about what makes a good API, I’ve given talks about that in the past - [see the slides](https://speakerdeck.com/pamelafox/developer-experience) or [watch the video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRTngumVnqw).

I love using APIs so much that I want to help others try to use them. I hope you find them as fun!

Hope to see you at future [meetups](https://meetup.com/Girl-Develop-It-San-Francisco/)!
