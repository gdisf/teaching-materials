      <h1>Git: Contribute To A Repo Exercise</h1>
      <p>The goal of this exercise is to see the social side of Github. At the end of this exercise, you will contribute to our student directory repo.</p>

      <h3>Part 1: Get your copy of the repo</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>On the <a href="https://github.com/mjawili/gdi-summer-2016-students" target="_blank">student directory repo</a> page, click on the "Fork" button in the upper right corner.</li>
        <li>In Github Desktop, under "File" &rarr; "Clone Repository", select "gdi-summer-2016-students" and click the "Clone gdi-summer-2016-students" button. (You might have to restart Github Desktop.)</li>
        <li>Navigate to an appropriate path for this repo, such as in the same folder as your portfolio's repo, and click the "Clone" button.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Part 2: Add your code!</h3>
      <h5>Make your changes locally</h5>
      <ol>
        <li>In your text editor, open <code>index.html</code> in the gdi-summer-2016-students repo.</li>
        <li>Add your code and save your changes. Include your to-be-online portfolio: <code>http://[your username].github.io/[your repo]</code>.</li>
        <li>In Github Desktop, with the gdi-summer-2016-students repo selected in the left panel, click on "View" &rarr; "Uncommitted Changes". Notice that <code>index.html</code> is listed in the middle panel, and your changes are highlighted in green in the right panel.</li>
        <li>In the form at the bottom of Github Desktop's middle panel, fill out the "Summary" and "Description" fields and click on the "Commit to gh-pages" button.</li>
      </ol>

      <h5>Push your changes to your repo on Github</h5>
      <ol>
        <li>In Github Desktop, click on the "Sync" button in the top right corner. That's it!</li>
        <li>Go to <code>https://github.com/[your username]/gh-pages</code> and see your commit!</li>
      </ol>

      <h5>Merge your changes into the original directory repo</h5>
      <ol>
        <li>In Github Desktop, click on the "Pull Request" button in the top right corner.</li>
        <li>Fill out the form with an appropriate title and description, and ensure that your branch is going into <code>mjawili/gdi-summer-2016-students</code>, and click the "Send Pull Request" button.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>That's it! Now just wait for your pull request to be merged. If it doesn't get merged, you'll receive some feedback why, and you can make any extra corrects and try again.</p>
