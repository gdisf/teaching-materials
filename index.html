              <li><span class="green">Fast!</span> Access information quickly and efficiently.</li>
              <li><span class="green">Distributed!</span> Everyone has her own local copy.</li>
              <li><span class="green">Mind-bogglingly scalable!</span> Enables potentially thousands (millions!) of developers to work on single project.
              <li><span class="green">Local!</span> You don't need a network connection to use it. You only need a remote server if you want to share your code with others (e.g., using GitHub).</li>
              <li><span class="green">Branches!</span> Keep your coding experiments separate from code that is already working.</li>
              <li>Everyone has a local copy of the <span class="green">shared files</span> and the <span class="green">history.</span></li>

             <li> A <span class="green">repository</span> is where you keep all the files you want to track.</li>
             <li> A <span class="green">branch</span> is the name for a separate line of development, with its own history.</li>
             <li> A <span class="green">commit</span> is an object that holds information about a particular change. </li>
             <li> <span class="green">HEAD</span> refers to the most recent commit on the current branch.</li>
