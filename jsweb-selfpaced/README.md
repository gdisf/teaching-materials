# {{ **Class:** JS200: Making Webpages Interactive with JavaScript (Self-Paced) }}

Want to make your webpages interactive? Then you'll need to use JavaScript, the language of the web. In this workshop, you'll learn how to use JavaScript with webpages - starting with using it to manipulate the HTML/CSS on a page, then attaching events to respond to user interaction, and finally, animating parts of your page.

This workshop will be largely "self-paced". That means that we'll start with a round of introductions and an overview, and then you'll watch videos and do coding challenges at your own pace, using Khan Academy. We will stop to work on pair projects every few hours, and we'll have TAs to answer questions and help when you get stuck.

## Topics covered

* JS DOM access
* JS DOM manipulation
* JS DOM events
* JS DOM animation

## Material

## Prerequisites

Attendees should be comfortable with HTML and CSS fundamentals (HTML tags and attributes, CSS selectors) and JavaScript fundamentals (syntax, data structures, conditionals, loops). That means that you attended our Intro to HTML & CSS workshop and Intro to JavaScript workshop or you learned those concepts online.

You can review them online at a few places:
* HTML & CSS: [Khan Academy's HTML & CSS course](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css), [Codecademy's HTML & CSS course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html), [GDI SF's HTML & CSS slides](https://www.teaching-materials.org/htmlcss-1day/)
* JS: [Khan Academy's Intro to JS course](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming), [Codecademy's JS course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-javascript), [GDI SF's JS slides](https://www.teaching-materials.org/javascript/)

## Tech requirements

* Your laptop (Mac, PC, Linux) and charger
* A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
* A text editor - we recommend either Sublime Text 2 or Atom (both free)

*If you do not have a laptop, please contact the instructors. We have a limited number of Chromebooks for students to borrow.*
