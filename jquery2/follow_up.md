Thanks for attending the workshop, and thank you to our TAs [TODO: TA names] for being such great helpers. We’d love your feedback on the workshop in this survey. [TODO: Add link to survey]

The slides are available at:
http://teaching-materials.org/jquery2/
We will try to always keep them available at that URL.

We’ve now covered 90% of what you’ll use in jQuery, so it’s time to practice, practice, practice. If you want to be around other folks practicing, come to the Monday HackReactor study groups or Wednesday Women-Who-Code study groups. RSVP on Meetup. [TODO: add meetup urls]
