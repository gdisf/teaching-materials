# Follow up

Thanks for attending the workshop, and thank you to our TAs [TODO: TA names] for being such great helpers. We’d love your feedback on the workshop in this survey [TODO: Add link to survey]

The slides are available at: http://www.teaching-materials.org/javascript/
We will always keep them available at that URL.

Remember to keep practicing. The key concepts we discussed were:
- Variables, statements and data types in JavaScript
- How to create and edit Arrays
- Functions - declared functions and anonymous functions 
- Objects

We encourage you to keep learning! The next part of this JavaScript series is Animation & Events and then, jQuery.  [TODO: Add links to workshops on meetup.com]
