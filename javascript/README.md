# JS 101: JavaScript fundamentals

Slides and materials are hosted [here](http://teaching-materials.org/javascript).

## Course description

JavaScript is the programming language that makes web pages interactive, and is now used these days to make servers, robots, and more. That makes it one of the most useful first languages to learn, if you're just getting started with programming, and particularly web development. In this workshop, you will learn the fundamentals of programming in JavaScript.

The workshop will be a mix of lectures and hands-on exercises in pairs, and will be taught by [teacher X, tiny bio]. This is a great workshop for students interested in our full frontend workshop series.
