<h2>Homework: The Word Guesser</h2>

<p>You'll create a simple word guessing game where the user gets infinite tries
to guess the word (like Hangman without the hangman, or like Wheel of Fortune without the wheel and fortune).
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create two global arrays: one to hold the letters of the word (e.g. 'F', 'O', 'X'), and one to hold the current guessed letters (e.g. it would start with '_', '_', '_' and end with 'F', 'O', 'X').
  <li>Write a function called <code>guessLetter</code> that will:
    <ul>
     <li>Take one argument, the guessed letter.
     <li>Iterate through the word letters and see if the guessed letter is in there.
     <li>If the guessed letter matches a word letter, changed the guessed letters array to reflect that.
     <li>When it's done iterating, it should log the current guessed letters ('F__')
     <li>and congratulate the user if they found a new letter.
     <li>It should also figure out if there are any more letters that need to be guessed,
     <li>and if not, it should congratulate the user for winning the game.
    </ul>
  <li>Pretend you don't know the word, and call <code>guessLetter</code> multiple times with various letters to check that your program works.
  <li><b>Bonus:</b> Make it more like Wheel of Fortune: 
    <ul>
      <li>Start with a reward amount of $0
      <li>Every time a letter is guessed, generate a random amount and reward the user if they found a letter (multiplying the reward if multiple letters found), otherwise subtract from their reward.
      <li>When they guess the word, log their final reward amount.
    </ul>
  <li><b>Bonus:</b> Make it like Hangman:
    <ul>
      <li>Keep track of all the guessed letters (right and wrong) and only let the user guess a letter once. If they guess a letter twice, do nothing.
      <li>Keep track of the state of the hangman as a number (starting at 0), and subtract or add to that number every time they make a wrong guess.
      <li>Once the number reaches 6 (a reasonable number of body parts for a hangman), inform the user that they lost and
      show a hangman on the log.
    </ul>
</ul>
