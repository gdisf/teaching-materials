Thanks again to everyone for coming to HTML 101! I hope you all had as much fun as I did.

If you haven't already, please fill out the [survey] to let us know how we did.

As I mentioned, you should now be prepared for several other GDI classes, including the "Beyond the Basics" HTML/CSS class, which covers advanced topics like HTML5 semantic elements, CSS3 animations, microdata, and CSS media queries that are used in responsive web development. An Intro to Javascript class would also be a great next step, if you're interested in building out more interactive functionality.

Some resources for further exploration/review:
- A lengthy explanation of positioning, if you just want to hear it again from the beginning: http://alistapart.com/article/css-positioning-101
- A video demonstration of relative and absolute positioning: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFtByxWjfLY
- Fun site using a combo of slides, tutorials, and exercises (requires sign up, but very cool): https://dash.generalassemb.ly/
- Exercises from the pair programming workshop we sometimes run: http://workshop.theresnobox.net/blog/categories/html-and-css/
- More on CSS selectors: http://www.impressivewebs.com/css-selectors/
- More on the box model: https://css-tricks.com/the-css-box-model/
- An infographic on what image file formats to use when: http://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2014/12/when-to-use-jpg-gif-and-png-infographic.html
- One color picker: http://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/ For help in choosing and specifying colors.

Last but not least, and very important, I am always available to you as a resource and am happy to answer questions via email [], twitter [], or slack [], and I am also happy to try to meet up for coffee, lunch, etc, though my schedule can be challenging. ;)

Hope to see you all again at future classes and tech stuff about town!
