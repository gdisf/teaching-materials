      <h1>Exercise: Backbone</h1>
      <br><br>

      <p>In this exercise, you will take the MVC app from the previous exercise and
        use Backbone for it instead.</p>

      <p>Go through these steps, and do as many as you can in the time we have:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Either use your solution from the last site or
          download <a href="exercise_view_solution.html">this file</a> and save it into your project folder.
          Open it up in your browser and make sure it works. You should see a list of videos,
          and when you click on them, a modal pops up that plays the video.</li>

        <li>Read through the code and try to understand what it's doing.</li>
        <li>Add a script tag for underscore.js and backbone.js, using the URLs at
          <A href="http://cdnjs.com/">cdnjs.com</a>. Backbone depends on underscore,
            so the backbone script tag should be after the underscore one.
        </li>

        <li><h3>Modeling The Data</h3></li>
        <li>Replace the current <code>VideoModel</code> with a <code>VideoModel</code>
          object that extends <code>Backbone.Model</code>.
          It should have default values for the title and author,
          and it should set the embed and preview URL in the <code>initialize</code> method.
        </li>
        <li>Replace the current <code>VideoCollection</code> with a <code>VideoCollection</code>
          object that extends <code>Backbone.Collection</code>.
          It should have a comparator based on the title property, so that the collection
          is sorted by title by default.
        </li>
        <li>Modify the code in <code>document.ready</code> to create a <code>VideoCollection</code>.
        </li>
        <li>Change the for loop to iterate through the items in the <code>VideoCollection></code> and
        pass them to the <code>VideoItemView</code>.
        </li>
        <li>Change your <code>VideoItemView</code> to use the attributes of the Backbone model via
          the <code>get</code> method.</li>
        <li>Try loading the page now and see if your code works. Are there any errors? Look at the console
          and work through them one by one. You will have to modify a few things in your <code>addVideoToList</code>
          function.
        </li>

        <li><h3>Creating the View</h3></li>
        <li>Replace <code>VideoItem</code> with a view that extends <code>Backbone.View</code>. Start by putting
          all of the current render logic into the <code>render</code> function. The <code>render</code> function should append
          new elements to <code>this.$el</code> and return <code>this</code>. The code should reference <code>this.model</code>,
          the model that belongs to the view.
        </li>
        <li>In the for loop in <code>document.ready</code>, change the code so that you pass in the video
          to <code>VideoItem</code> as the model. Call the render function and append the view's element to the global div.
        </li>
        <li>Try loading the page and see if you can get the list of videos to display. </li>
        <li>Now, add <code>events</code> to the view and make an event for <code>click</code> on the <code>a</code> element,
          which calls a <code>renderModal</code> function. Move the modal rendering code into that function.
        </li>
        <li>Try loading the page now and see if you can get the modal to display when clicking the video.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>Make sure that you use your browser developer tools to make debugging easier
while working on this. Check for errors, and use console.log() to figure out
how far your code makes it, and what the values of your variables are along the way.</p>
