        "review": "This is Gary's first book on obesity & nutrition research, and is very heavy on the science/research details. It talks a lot about the bad science that got us to where we are today, and in the end it talks about the carbohydrate hypothesis. It's good if you're patient, but if not, go for \"Why We Get Fat\", which distills the information down to a much easier read.",
