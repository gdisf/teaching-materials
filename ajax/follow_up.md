Thanks for attending the workshop, and thank you to our TAs [TODO: TA names] for being such great helpers. Weâ€™d love your feedback on the workshop in this survey. [TODO: Add link to survey]

The slides are available at:
<http://www.teaching-materials.org/ajax/>
We will try to always keep them available at that URL.

The upcoming JS APIs workshop will show how to do cross-domain requests and get data from other servers.  The OO MVC and Backbone workshops will build on top of AJAX to build a more structured data-driven webapp.

Here are some relevant online tutorials on AJAX:

* <http://www.jquery4u.com/json/ajaxjquery-getjson-simple/>

Want to try AJAX with some APIs? Here are some open ones that you might enjoy:

* [US Gov Open Data](http://www.data.gov/)

I recommend opening up your dev tools on your favorite websites and see what AJAX calls they make. Get curious.
