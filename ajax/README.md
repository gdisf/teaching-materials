# JS302: AJAX/JSON

In this workshop, you'll learn ways you can use data in your webpages, using AJAX to pull in JSON formatted data dynamically from servers.

The workshop will be a mix of lectures and hands-on exercises in pairs. It will be taught by **{{ teacher_name }}**, {{ teacher_description }}.

This is a great follow-up workshop for those who attended our JS301: Intro to jQuery workshop.
