# JSON & AJAX

Slides and materials are hosted [here](https://www.teaching-materials.org/ajax/#/).

## Course description

In this workshop, you'll learn ways you can use data in your webpages, using AJAX
to pull in JSON formatted data dynamically from servers.

The workshop will be a mix of lectures and hands-on exercises in pairs, and will be taught by [teacher X, tiny bio]. This is a great follow-up workshop for those who have attended our jQuery workshop.

### Prerequisites:

Attendees should be comfortable with HTML/CSS fundamentals and JavaScript fundamentals (arrays, conditionals, loops, functions). Attendees should also have learned the DOM API and jQuery. That means that you either attended our HTML 101 workshop, JS 101 workshop, JS for the Web workshop, and JQuery workshop, or that you learned those concepts online.
