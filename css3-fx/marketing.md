Join this workshop to learn modern CSS3 properties to style and animate your  webpage. This is a great follow-up workshop for those who have attended our HTML/CSS workshop. These classes are an awesome complement to HTML5. CSS3 gives you a lot of power to style and animate your pages without having to learn JavaScript! 

CSS3 introduced a ton of selectors that most people don't use-- but every time I teach this class, I find myself using one of the selectors later that week and being super happy I knew about its existence. So, come up your selection game! :slightly_smiling_face:

We also have scholarships available.
