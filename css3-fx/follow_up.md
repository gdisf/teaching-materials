#CSS3 Effects & Animation Workshop Follow-Up

Hi all!

Thanks for attending the workshop, and thank you to our TAs **[TODO:TA names]** for being such great helpers. We’d love your feedback on the class [in this survey](), if you didn't already fill it out in class.

The slides will remain online at http://www.teaching-materials.org/css3-fx/

## Practice, Practice:

There are study groups every Wednesday through [Women Who Code](http://www.meetup.com/women-who-code-sf/). Those are a great opportunity to work on exercises or your own personal blog/website. If you are working on your own, you can post questions in the GDI SF [#help-desk channel](https://gdisf.slack.com/messages/help-desk/).

## Future Classes
There's still more CSS to learn! Check out these upcoming workshops: **[TODO: meetup urls/titles]**.

If you haven't yet, you also want to learn JavaScript, the language we use for making webpages interactive. 
JS 101 is coming up on **[TODO: insert JS 101 date]**. You can RSVP here: **[TODO: meetup URL]**.

After that, we’ll have more advanced JS workshops **[TODO: insert dates and examples]** to give you a full tour of Front End Web Development.

Looking forward to seeing you at future workshops!
