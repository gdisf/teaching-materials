			Overview
		</h2>
    
    <p>This course gives an overview of HTML &amp; CSS, with some mention of newer HTML5 features.
    There are six lessons and they can be given in a one-day workshop:</p>
    
    <ul>
     <li><a href="#lesson1">Lesson 1: Intro to the Web</a></li>
		 <li><a href="#lesson2">Lesson 2: Intro to HTML</a></li>
		 <li><a href="#lesson3">Lesson 3: Advanced HTML Tags</a></li>
		 <li><a href="#lesson4">Lesson 4: Intro to CSS</a></li>
     <li><a href="#lesson5">Lesson 5: CSS Layout</a></li>
     <li><a href="#lesson6">Lesson 6: CSS Tools &amp; Techniques</a></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Prerequisite</h3>
    <p>The students should be familiar with the web as a user, but do not need to have any programming or markup language experience.</p>
    
    <h3>Materials</h3>
    
    <p>Each lesson includes:</p>

     <ul>
      <li><b>Slides</b>: An HTML5-based slideset (<em>not</em> a PowerPoint) which embeds the actual HTML tags being described in order to better demonstrate them.
      <li><b>In-class example</b>: An example of what the teacher should build up during the course of the lesson, switching between talking over the slides and demonstrating the concepts in the example page. 
      <li><b>Exercise(s)</b>: These can be started in class and then continued outside of it, and the teacher can decide when to reveal the solution for the exercises. For the most part, the solution to an exercise serves as the starting point for the next exercise. 
      <li><b>Additional Reading</b>: Links that teachers can recommend students read after a lesson.
      <li><b>Related Resources</b>: Slides or tutorials that were useful in the creation of the lesson content. Teachers can visit these to get an idea of how other people present the content.
      <li><b>Room for Improvement</b>: A list of ways that the particular lesson might be improved.
     </ul>
    
    <p>The materials from the above lessons (slides, examples, exercises) can be downloaded in <a href="htmlcss-1day.zip">this zip file</a>.</p>
    
    <h3>Related Resources</h3>
    
    <p>The content for the slides was based on consultation with a number of fantastic online resources, including the <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/">HTML5 specification</a>, <a href="http://interact.webstandards.org/">WASP Interact Curriculum</a>, and the <a href="http://www.opera.com/company/education/curriculum/">Opera Web Standards Curriculum</a>. Those are recommended reading for teachers of this course.

       </ul> 

       <h3>Room for Improvement:</h3>
       <ul>
         <li>Add slide(s) on HTTP basics (so that explaining forms is easier later).</li>
       </ul>
      
    </div>

    <div id="lesson2" class="lesson">
      <h2>
        Lesson 2: Intro to HTML
      </h2>
      
      <h3>Topics:</h3>
      
      <p>HTML History, HTML tag syntax, Basic HTML tags</p>
      
      <h3>Materials:</h3>

        <li><a href="lesson2/inclass.html">In-Class Example</a>

       <h3>Room for Improvement:</h3>
       <ul>
        <li>On the text editors slide, make sure to actually demonstrate saving a file and opening it on the desktop vs. in Cloud9,
        as that's a source of confusion during the exercise.
        <li>Consider adding a slide about the difference between XML and HTML (particularly if the students had prior exposure to XHTML - as they will be confused about the different best practices).
        <li>Reiterate that the <code>title</code> element goes in the <code>head</code> and is not rendered on the page (this seems a matter of great confusion for newbies).
        <li>Consider talking about the HTML as a tree structure (DOM).
        <li>Consider downloading a screen reader and having them hear a page read aloud, so that they understand the need for accessible HTML.
        <li>Make the HTML history slide more concise (less text-y). Clarify what was wrong with IETF's standard (why W3C was needed).
        <li>Consider explaining <code>meta charset</code> and encoding.
       </ul>

      <h3>Room for Improvement:</h3>
      <ul>
       <li>Add a slide on "Forms in HTML5": input type="email", "url", form validation.
       <li>Possibly include a bit more information (a diagram?) on form->server interaction, and why the <code>name</code> attribute is important for a database-driven system, perhaps set up a basic server side script for users to post to (that simply outputs what they sent to it), and show the code for that on the slide.
       <li>Explain basics of HTTP - GET vs. POST, show NET tab, show example of GET/POST requests.
       <li>Maybe give basic explanation of cookies.
       <li>Show example form for a user login or guestbook (POST).
       <li>For Google search example, show how easy it is to change it to search Twitter or other sites.
       <li>Maybe mention existence of <code>framesrc</code> tag (<a href="http://www-scf.usc.edu/~csci571/">example site</a>) and why it's not a best practice (<a href="http://accessibility.psu.edu/frames">accessibility</a>)
       <li>Add a single slide on "Multimedia in HTML5" - video/audio tag.
       <li>Consider removing object/embed entirely, as it's only used in copy/paste (and iframe is more common now anyway).
       <li>Add an exercise on embedding.
      </ul>

       <h3>Room for Improvement:</h3>
        <ul>
         <li>Explain the "cascading" of rules better/more.
         <li>Consider adding attribute selection, like <code>input[type="text"]</code>.
         <li>Include a slide on debugging CSS - show example of when rules break (invalid property value), 
         show changing properties, adding styles, viewing :hover properties.
         <li>Clarify font-size section better, it's confusing now. Maybe change order that the units are explained in. Possibly introduce rem sizing.
         <li>Consider adding a slide on selectors in CSS3 (nth child, odd, etc).
         <li>Add additional exercise or bonus in exercise on using web fonts (Google fonts).
         <li>Consider mentioning HSL and alpha in colors section (though it's IE8+).
         <li>Add additional exercise on colors - like implementing a color scheme from colourlovers or colorscheme site.
         <li>Make a version of in-class example that is the "before" (same with all in-class examples).
         <li>Students find inline styles confusing. Not sure how best to remedy.</p>

        <ul>
         <li>The timing of when span is introduced is a bit awkward. Maybe change.

         <li>Add an exercise (or modify final exercise) where the student moves their CSS into an external file.
