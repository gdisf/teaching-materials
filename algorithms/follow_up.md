# GDI SF Algorithms Workshop Follow-Up

Thanks for attending the workshop, and thank you to our TAs **[TODO: TA names]** for being such great helpers. We’d love your feedback [in this survey](https://docs.google.com/a/girldevelopit.com/forms/d/1nwx55EOUjoTH7uhVs1vYNRlFVUl6x4s1t4SBr3OHqXQ/viewform).

You can reach the slides at:

And here are some other follow-up links for a deeper overview of algorithms:
* [Coursera Algorithms classes](https://www.coursera.org/courses?orderby=upcoming&search=algorithms) (Algorithms Part 1 from Princeton recommended)
* [Khan Academy Algorithms](http://khanacademy.org/algorithms)
* [JavaScript and Computer Science](http://www.nczonline.net/blog/tag/computer-science/)
* [WomenWhoCode Algorithms Study Night](http://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-SF/events/226022764/)
* [“Cracking the Coding Interview”](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X/?tag=amazonsimilar-20) ([and similar books](http://www.books-like-this.com/098478280X))

And here are some other fun bonus links:
* [Nice explanation of Simulated Annealing](http://katrinaeg.com/simulated-annealing.html)
* [XKCD: Bad Algorithms](http://xkcd.com/1185/)
* [Making TSP art](http://www.oberlin.edu/math/faculty/bosch/making-tspart-page.html)
* [Clever Algorithms: Nature inspired algorithms](http://www.cleveralgorithms.com/)
* [Networks, Crowds, and Markets](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/)

I recommend trying to use a few algorithms yourself - like by putting together a visualization using JS or using them in a project you’re already working on or dreaming up.

Happy algorithming!
