# {{ **Class:** Algorithms 101 }}

## What's an algorithm?

Besides being the answer to most interview questions, an algorithm is a way to solve a particular problem in programming.  

Google Maps uses an algorithm to calculate driving directions through 3 cities while avoiding highways. Amazon uses an algorithm to figure out exactly what product to recommend to you next so that you'll blindly one-click it.

In this workshop, we will discuss what an algorithm is, introduce the idea of algorithmic complexity (big O notation), demonstrate sort and search algorithms (with a hands-on re-enactment), and finish with an overview of the many types of algorithms out there.

This workshop focuses on design-thinking for algorithms, which is a pre-requisite to expressing these ideas in code. It will be taught by **{{ teacher_name }}**, {{ teacher_description }}.

A great follow-up workshop to this one is our Whiteboarding Interview Prep.

*There will be an hour break for lunch.*

## Prerequisites

Attendees would benefit from a basic understanding of a programming language, like from JS 101, but that is not required.

## Tech requirements

* Your laptop (Mac, PC, Linux) and charger
* A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

*If you do not have a laptop, please contact the instructors. We have a limited number of Chromebooks for students to borrow.*
