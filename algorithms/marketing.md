Besides being the answer to most interview questions, an algorithm is a way to solve a particular problem in programming.  In this workshop, we will discuss what an algorithm is, introduce the idea of algorithmic complexity (big O notation), demonstrate sort and search algorithms (with a hands-on re-enactment), and finish with an overview of the many types of algorithms out there. This workshop focuses on design-thinking for algorithms, which is a pre-requisite to expressing these ideas in code.
