    <p>We need more web developers in the world.</p>

    <p>There are many people out there that want to be web developers but don't know how.
    Fortunately, <a href="http://blog.pamelafox.org/2012/04/learning-to-code-online.html">many universities, startups, and non-profits</a> are experimenting with ways
    to learn web development online, but there is another way: good old hands-on
    teaching. That's what we want to make easier.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you're a web developer already, you already have the knowledge you need to
    be able to teach others - so all you need next is curriculum, logistics, and students.
    Here's a guide to putting together those pieces and teaching the web to budding developers near you.
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li><h3>Curriculum</h3>
      <p>A good curriculum includes both slides and exercises, giving you the opportunity to teach
      conceptually and giving students the opportunity to practice what you've taught. That's what we try to provide here,
      but we encourage you to extend it or build your own for new topics.
     <li><h3>Venue</h3>
     <p>The ideal venue will have a projector, a whiteboard, tables &amp; chairs, WiFi, and enough power outlets.
      It doesn't need to be huge - you can start with just a handful of folks in a conference room - and
      in fact, you probably should keep it to around 30-40 students, to make sure students still get individual attention.
      Some ideas for venues are: your workplace, local web companies/startups, co-working spaces, libraries, universities.</p>
     <li><h3>Date</h3>
     <p>Since most people that want to learn web development already have a day job, a good date for a class would be on a weekend (like all-day on a Saturday) or a series of weekday evenings (e.g. every Monday for a month). 
       Try not to do it on holidays, and give yourself atleast a few weeks to advertise.
      </p>
     <li><h3>Students</h3>
      <p>You can use skillshare.com to advertise your event (and hey, you should charge a bit of money too &mdash; if it's sustainable, then you can do more of them). Then start spreading the word - your friends may already be developers, but they probably have relatives, friends, or coworkers that aren't -
      remind them of that. You can also tell your own relatives, friends, and coworkers, of course.
    </ol>
