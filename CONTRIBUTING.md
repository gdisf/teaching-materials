# Contributing 

We're so glad you want to contribute! Here are a couple of tips for contributing successfully:

1. Please make sure your revision history is as easy to read as possible
2. Separate content changes from whitespace changes (if your Text Editor does this automatically, please do not include those changes)
3. Serve your file locally and check your work before submitting
4. Submit your work with a summary of your changes and a screenshot if relevant

## Repository Structure

Our materials are deployed as static pages using Github Pages. Links will be directly correlated with file paths. Github Pages will also automatically resolve `index.html` pages. 

All of our core curricula are linked from the root [index.html](www.teaching-materials.org) page.
