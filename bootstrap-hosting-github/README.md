## Course description
In this two-day project-based workshop, you'll learn how to go beyond with HTML and CSS: using the popular CSS Framework Bootstrap for responsive design and pre-built components, and getting your website to go live.

The comprehensive workshop will be a mix of lectures, pair programming, and hands-on exercises building your webpage, and will be taught by Mary Ann Jawili, Software Engineer at Salesforce, and Truc Nguyen, UX Designer at AdRoll.

By the end of this two-day workshop, you will know the following:
* How to make a responsive web page using a framework like Bootstrap (e.g making your web page look great on phones, tablets, and desktop computers)
* How to host it on Github Pages so everyone can check out your new website!
