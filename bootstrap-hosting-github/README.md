Directory: /bootstrap-hosting-github/

In this project-based workshop, you'll learn how to go beyond with HTML and CSS: using the popular CSS Framework Bootstrap for responsive design and pre-built components.

The comprehensive workshop will be a mix of lectures, pair programming, and hands-on exercises building your webpage. It will be taught by **{{ teacher_name }}**, {{ teacher_description }}.

By the end of this workshop, you will know how to make a responsive web page using a framework like Bootstrap (e.g making your web page look great on phones, tablets, and desktop computers).

This is a great follow-up workshop for those who attended our Intro to HTML & CSS workshop. 

*There will be an hour break for lunch.*
