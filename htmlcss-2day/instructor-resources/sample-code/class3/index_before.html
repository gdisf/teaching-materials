	<p>To climb safely, you will need a few pieces of <span class="pretty">basic equipment</span>. Most rock climbing gyms will rent this equipment to you. You can also buy your own equipment from an outdoor gear store like <a href="http://www.rei.com">REI</a>, or look for used gear on <a href="http://raleigh.craigslist.org/">Craigslist</a>. I highly recommend using rental gear first, before you buy. That will give you a change to find out what you like. 
	<span class="pretty">Remember</span>, you can don't have to buy everything at once.</p>
