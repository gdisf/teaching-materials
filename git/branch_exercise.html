        <h1>Exercise: Branches!</h1>
        <p>In this exercise, you will adding new features to your pet adoption website.  You will be adding a gallery page, and if there is time, a contact page.</p>

        <p>As you read through these steps, think about when would be a good time to commit.  As you execute the steps, YOU get to decide when to commit.</p>

        <h4>Set up</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Switch back to your project folder with your pet adoption website.</li>
            <li>Use git status to double check to make sure you have no modified/uncommitted changes</li>
            <li>Use git branch to double check what branch you are on (it should be master!)</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>2. Gallery Page</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Create a new branch name gallery-feature</li>
            <li>Add a gallery.html.  If you don't want to write a bunch of html and text, you can just copy the contents of this file: <a href="./exercise-sample-code/gallery.html" download="gallery.html">index.html</a></li>
            <li>Add some more images to your images folder.  If you have time, create some image tags inside of gallery.html and include the images from the images folder.</li>
            <li>Anything else you can think of that would work well on a gallery page</li>
            <li>At this point you should have at least one or more commits on your gallery branch (use git log to double check!).  
        </ol>

        <h4>3. Contact Page</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 30px;"> Don't forget to run <span class="green"style="font-family: monospace;">git status</span> regularly so that you can see what is happening at each stage!</h4>
