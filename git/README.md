# Class: Intro to Git and Github

Git is a distributed version control system, it can be used as a server out of the box. Dedicated Git server software adds access control, display the contents of a Git repository via the web, and help to manage multiple repositories. 

GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as wikis and basic task management tools for every project.
