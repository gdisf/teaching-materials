        <h1>Exercise: Commits!</h1>
        <p>In this exercise, you will be creating a repository and adding some project files.  You will be working on creating a very simple adoption website for dogs (or any animal you like).</p>

        <p>As you read through these steps, think about when would be a good time to commit.  As you execute the steps, YOU get to decide when to commit.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Create a new folder on your Desktop and make it a repository.</li>
            Hint: Do not be inside of your current project folder when you make a new folder.  Make sure you are on your desktop!
            <br />
            Hint 2: make sure you are inside of the folder when you make it a repository!
            <li>Add an index.html.  If you don't want to write a bunch of html and text, you can just copy the contents of this file: <a href="./exercise-sample-code/index.html" download="index.html">index.html</a></li>
            <li>Would this be a good time to commit?</li>
            <li>Add a css folder with a css file.  Add some basic css. You can also just copy the contents of this file:  <a href="./exercise-sample-code/custom.css" download="custom.css">custom.css</a></li>
            <li>How about this time?  Is this a good time to commit?</li>
            <li>Create an images folder and add three images.  If you have time, create some image tags inside of your html and include the images from the images folder.</li>
            <li>Commit, perhaps?</li>
            <li>Look at your history with <span class="green"style="font-family: monospace;">git log</span> as you add more commits (and try adding the <span class="green"style="font-family: monospace;">--oneline</span> option) </li>
        </ol>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 30px;"> Don't forget to run <span class="green"style="font-family: monospace;">git status</span> regularly so that you can see what is happening at each stage!</h4>
