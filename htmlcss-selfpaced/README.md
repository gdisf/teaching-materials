# Intro to HTML & CSS (Self-Paced)

In this workshop, you'll learn HTML and CSS, the languages used by the billions of webpages out there today to mark up and style content. HTML and CSS are incredibly useful skills for bloggers, content creators, email marketers, small business owners, designers, and are absolutely necessary skills front-end web developers. 

This 2-day workshop will be largely "self-paced". That means that we'll start with a round of introductions and an overview, and then you'll watch videos and do coding challenges at your own pace, using Khan Academy. We will stop to work on pair projects every few hours, and we'll have TAs to answer questions and help when you get stuck.
