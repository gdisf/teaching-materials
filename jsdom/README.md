# JS DOM Review

You know how to write a JavaScript function, and you also understand HTML and CSS. But do you remember how to put the two together? In this workshop, you'll review how JavaScript interacts with the DOM (Document Object Model). We will talk about DOM traversal, as well as review events and callbacks.
The workshop will be a mix of lectures and hands-on exercises in pairs. It will be taught by {{ teacher_name }}, {{ teacher_description }}.

This is a great follow-up workshop for those who attended our Intro to JavaScript workshop.

### Topics covered

* JS DOM traversal
* JS DOM events / callbacks
* DOM coding best practices

### Prerequisites

Attendees should be comfortable with HTML and CSS fundamentals (HTML tags and attributes, CSS selectors) and JavaScript fundamentals (syntax, data structures, conditionals, loops). Attendees should also be comfortable with the DOM API (access and modification methods). That means that you attended our Intro to HTML & CSS workshop, Intro to JavaScript workshop, and Making Webpages Interactive workshop, or you learned those concepts online.

You can review them online at a few places:
* HTML/CSS: [Khan Academy's HTML/CSS course](https://khanacademy.org/html-css), [Codecademy's HTML/CSS course](https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web), [GDI SF HTML/CSS slides](http://teaching-materials.org/htmlcss-1day)
* JS: [Codecademy's JS course](https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript), [Khan Academy's Intro to JS course](https://khanacademy.org/programming),  [GDI SF JS slides](http://teaching-materials.org/javascript)
* DOM API: [Khan Academy's "Making Webpages Interactive" course](https://khanacademy.org/html-css-js)

### Tech requirements

* Your laptop (Mac, PC, Linux) and charger
* A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
* A text editor - we recommend either Sublime Text 2 or Atom (both free)

If you do not have a laptop, please contact the instructors. We have a limited number of Chromebooks for students to borrow.
