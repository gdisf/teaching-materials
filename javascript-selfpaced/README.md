#  JS101: Intro to JavaScript (Self-Paced)

JavaScript is the programming language that makes web pages interactive. It is also used to make servers, robots, and more! That makes it one of the most useful first languages to learn. In this workshop, you will learn the fundamentals of programming in JavaScript.

This 2-day workshop will be largely "self-paced". That means that we'll start with a round of introductions and an overview, and then you'll watch videos and do coding challenges at your own pace, using Khan Academy. We will stop to work on pair projects every few hours, and we'll have TAs to answer questions and help when you get stuck.

### Topics covered

* JS variables
* JS functions
* JS logic
* JS loops & arrays
* ProcessingJS functions
