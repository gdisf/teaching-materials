# JS for the Web: Making webpages interactive

Slides and materials are hosted [here](http://teaching-materials.org/jsweb).

## Course description

Want to make your webpages interactive? Then you'll need to use JavaScript, the language of the web.
In this workshop, you'll learn how to use JavaScript with webpages - starting with using it to manipulate the HTML/CSS on a page, then attaching events to respond to user interaction, and finally, animating parts of your page.

The workshop will be a mix of lectures and hands-on exercises in pairs, and will be taught by [teacher X, tiny bio]. This is the perfect follow-up workshop for those who have attended our HTML/CSS workshop and JS 101 workshops.

### Prerequisites:

Attendees should be comfortable with HTML/CSS fundamentals (HTML tags and attributes, CSS selectors) and JavaScript fundamentals (syntax, data structures, conditionals, loops). That means that you either attended our HTML 101 workshop and JS 101 workshop, or that you learned those concepts online. 

You can review them online at a few places:
