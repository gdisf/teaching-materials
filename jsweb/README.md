# Class: JS200: Making Webpages Interactive with JavaScript
Directory: /jsweb/

Want to make your webpages interactive? Then you'll need to use JavaScript, the language of the web. In this workshop, you'll learn how to use JavaScript with webpages - starting with using it to manipulate the HTML/CSS on a page, then attaching events to respond to user interaction, and finally, animating parts of your page.

The workshop will be a mix of lectures and hands-on exercises in pairs. It will be taught by **{{ teacher_name }}**, {{ teacher_description }}.

This is the perfect follow-up workshop for those who attended our Intro to HTML & CSS workshop and Intro to JavaScript workshop.

There will be an hour break for lunch.
